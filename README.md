# Udacity Identify Customer Segments
Identify Customer Segments Project from Udacity's Intro to ML with Pytorch (jupyter notebook, python, sklearn, numpy, pandas)

- Unsupervised Learning project.  Clean customer data and general population data from Arvato and use it to draw conclusions about
customers for a mail-order service as they relate to the general population in features such as: personality, age, wealth, family type,
etc.

- Conduct analysis via kmeans, pca, scaling, etc. to get accurate, data-driven information about customers.

- Draw conclusions about over and under-represented customer subgroups in the data provided based on clustering proportions
and the features of the clusters.
